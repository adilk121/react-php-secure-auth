# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a Secure login system built using React Mysql and  PHP with JWT tokens for authentication. It allows users to register, login, and view their profile information. (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features
User registration
User login with JWT token authentication
User profile page
User logout functionality


##Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Import the database.sql file to your MySQL database.
Navigate to the api directory and run composer install to install the necessary dependencies.
Rename the .env.example file to .env and update the DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASS values to match your MySQL database configuration.
Start the PHP server by running php -S localhost:8000 from the api directory.
Navigate to the client directory and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
Start the React app by running npm start from the client directory.


Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
